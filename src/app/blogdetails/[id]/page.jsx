            This Out!\n\nBathrooms are one of the most underrated corners of our
            homes. A clean bathroom is a necessity to wash off your tiredness
            after a busy day. This is also the place where you start your day
            afresh. So it’s crucial to keep it clean and fresh. More often than

            \n\n1. Baking soda and vinegar: If your major concern has been how
            to clean bathroom tiles stains, mix these two ingredients up and
            spray them across your bathroom floor and wall tiles. Once you’re
            done with spraying, all you have to do is give it a good scrub, wash
            it off with some water, and you will see that the stains have
            reduced.\n\n2. Toilet cleaner liquid and washing powder: Make sure
            you cover your bathroom floor and tiles with a toilet cleaner liquid
            and leave it to sit for about three to four hours. Add some washing
            powder to hot water and mix it well. Use a spray bottle to spray it
            on the tiles. Now cover the tiles again with a layer of cleaning
            liquid. Get sandpaper and scrub off the stains and then use a sponge
            for a final scrub. After this, wash everything with warm water and
            dry it with a cloth. You are sure to see a major difference for the
            efforts you put in. \n\n3. Chemical Cleaners: The most effective
            method for cleaning stubborn stains on [bathroom floor tiles] is to
            use chemical tile cleaners available in hardware shops. These
            cleaners are highly effective and should be used only once in three
            months. You can spray the cleaner across your bathrooms and give it
            a good scrub before you wash it off.\n\nPro Tip: Always use gloves
            while cleaning as there can be harsh chemicals involved in cleaning
            products.
